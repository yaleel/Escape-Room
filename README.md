# Escape-Room
A simple escape room game using JavaFX libraries and MySQL database

to run this program you must:
1- have JavaFX libraries in your IDE
2- have a MySQL server
3- connect hibernate file to "this script.sql" schema 

this project was done by Athary, Abrar, Rola, Raghad and me

if you're facing an error because of the build try the following solution:
1-inside your IDE right click on the project
2-select "clean"
3-close the IDE after it's done and re-open it
4-right click on the project
5-select "clean and build"

and that should do it
